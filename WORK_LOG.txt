TO-DO: 
[x] unique labels are cleared when tool is changed or next bottom is pressed. This obligates that each times
the labels have to be re-entered again. Unchange this!!!
[x] semantic labels should be in image format. Look-up what format is the kitti version. 
Caution, the original image is down scaled, so be aware that either the image is re-saved in the new scale 
or the semantic image is up-scaled to the scale of the original image. 
[] Creation os a source and a destination browser bottom to automate the saving precess



LOG:
03/11/2020: Changed the segment file to segmentation image. Files are created at the parent 
folder of the origin image. 

09/10/2020  Today I finished the first complete version: bounding box and segmentation. 
Both features are able to save the selected elements to a file.

07/10/2020 Today I finished the first version of the bounding box saving to a file feature
   ERRORS: clear bbox list every times the NEXT button is pressed
   
06/10/2020 Today I finished the feature to get mouse positions from the image. I also started to split the application in two: segmentation and bounding box
   The segmentation part reads mouse positions with a kernel at the mouse pointer. The bounding box part needs the definitions of two corners to form a bounding box.
   Both applications are not finished. Namely the bounding box part just defines bounding boxes up.
   I used Tkinter library and the canvas layout to get mouse positions from images

[27/09/2020] Today I finished the image resizing code.
[22/09/2020] Will create a GUI based on the following site: https://realpython.com/pysimplegui-python/
 - I developed the first version of the segmentation GUI in the script "script_segemt_tool.py"
 TASK_TO_DO: 
    - read pixels from image
    - resize images to fit the screen
