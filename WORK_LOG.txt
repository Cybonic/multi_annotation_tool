07/10/2020 Today I finished the first version of the bounding box saving to a file feature
   ERRORS: clear bbox list every times the NEXT button is pressed
   
06/10/2020 Today I finished the feature to get mouse positions from the image. I also started to split the application in two: segmentation and bounding box
   The segmentation part reads mouse positions with a kernel at the mouse pointer. The bounding box part needs the definitions of two corners to form a bounding box.
   Both applications are not finished. Namely the bounding box part just defines bounding boxes up.
   I used Tkinter library and the canvas layout to get mouse positions from images

[27/09/2020] Today I finished the image resizing code.
[22/09/2020] Will create a GUI based on the following site: https://realpython.com/pysimplegui-python/
 - I developed the first version of the segmentation GUI in the script "script_segemt_tool.py"
 TASK_TO_DO: 
    - read pixels from image
    - resize images to fit the screen
